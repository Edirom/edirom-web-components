# Demonstrators for web components

On [this page](https://edirom.github.io/edirom-web-components/), the web components developed in the Edirom Online Reloaded project are intended to be used in the Edirom Online, but since they are completely independent modules they can be (re-)used in other contexts and web applications as well. 

For demonstration purposes the components are cloned into this repository as submodules and are inserted in HTML files which show how the components look like and how internal and external interaction works.
 
## Edirom Audio Player

This web component implements an audio player based on the HTML5 audio facility. It can be tested here, external interaction with the component is demonstrated by HTML forms: [demo page](https://edirom.github.io/edirom-web-components/demos/edirom-audio-player.html)

Further conceptual and technical information can be found on the [submodule page of the component](https://edirom.github.io/edirom-web-components/edirom-audio-player/). 

## Edirom Verovio Renderer

This web component implements an MEI renderer based on Verovio. It can be tested here, external interaction with the component is demonstrated by HTML forms: [demo page](https://edirom.github.io/edirom-web-components/demos/verovio-renderer.html)

Further conceptual and technical information can be found on the [submodule page of the component](https://edirom.github.io/edirom-web-components/edirom-verovio-renderer/). 


## Edirom Image Viewer

This web component displays IIIF tile sources using openseadragon library. It can be tested here, external interaction with the component is demonstrated by HTML forms: [demo page](https://edirom.github.io/edirom-web-components/demos/edirom-image-viewer.html)

Further conceptual and technical information can be found on the [submodule page of the component](https://edirom.github.io/edirom-web-components/edirom-image-viewer/). 



## Edirom Windows

This web component displays and creates new windows using the [winbox library](https://nextapps-de.github.io/winbox/). It can be tested here, external interaction with the component is demonstrated by different methods:
* navigation menu opens new windows (incl. web components for audio player, verovio rendering, and openseadragon image viewing): [navigation demo page](https://edirom.github.io/edirom-web-components/demos/navigation/index.html)
* buttons with sample actions: [sample actions demo page](https://edirom.github.io/edirom-web-components/demos/windows-sample-actions.html)

Further conceptual and technical information can be found on the [submodule page of the component](https://edirom.github.io/edirom-web-components/edirom-window/).
